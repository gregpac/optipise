internal climate monitoring tool based on openenergymonitor and emoncms, using winode as sensor node, RFM12B as transmitter between nodes and a RPi server. An emonglcd is used as mobile device to check radio transmission of data. 
The system is intended for use in internal climate and energy consumption monitoring of rammed earth heritage in the regions around Lyon, France. 
This is an exploratory project of CRATerre-ENSAG (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Architecture de Grenoble) since 09/2012. 
Any contribution/reuse is welcome !
